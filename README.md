The Challenge is to make HTML accessible by simplifying the code and using semantic elements.
The language and country of the website should be declared in the code using the lang tag in the header.
The div element is non-semantic, button element is semantic.
Use button where it applies.
Images need descriptions.
Add alt tag to img, src tags and make a short but concise description in quotations marks.
Make sure the website does not break.
